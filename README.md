# Tsukuyumi Board Generator

This is a board generator for the board game [Tsukuyumi](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/299450/tsukuyumi-full-moon-down-second-edition).

The rules say to place the area tiles randomly, but humans are notoriously bad at randomness. This is especially so considering the fact that the tiles are double sided, so it's hard to avoid being influeced by the partially built board when placing new tiles.
